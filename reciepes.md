Melt chocolates and scoop the melt into a decorating bag with a #4 tip.
Print out the emoji face template and then tape a piece of wax paper over it.
Trace the faces with chocolate melt.
Toast as many waffles as you wish to decorate.
Slice off the top of each strawberry and then cut in half lengthwise. Use cookie cutters to make 1 small heart, 2 bigger hearts, and 1 oval.  Cut bananas into cylinders for eyes.
TIME TO DECORATE!
Use the templates as a visual guide and place the chocolate and fruit slices on the waffles to look like the emoji faces .
TaDa! The Emoji Waffles are expressing how excited they are to be eaten!
